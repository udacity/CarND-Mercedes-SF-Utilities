# CarND-Mercedes-SF-Utilities
Tools for Sensor Fusion processing.

---

These tools were created by the team at Mercedes during the development of the
Sensor Fusion module.

We're providing them as-is for the time being, but I'm more than happy to take
a look at any PRs if you see room for improvement!

### 1. matlab_examples/

Here, you'll find the Matlab code used to generate the sample data in the
project. Feel free to generate your own data for practice if you have access to
Matlab. [_Note: this is NOT necessary for completing either project. You do NOT
need access to Matlab. At the moment, we cannot help you get a license to
Matlab. Yes, we agree it's too expensive and it would be really cool if we
could help you get cheap licenses._]

### 2. python/
You'll find a few Jupyter notebooks here that you might find useful for
visualizing and analyzing your data. Some files are hardcoded so you might need
to edit them before you get any use out of the notebooks.
